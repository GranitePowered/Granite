=============

## Moved

**This repository is obsolete! Development on modern (1.16+) versions continues in the [Sponge](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Sponge) repository.**

## Prerequisites
* [Java] 8

## Cloning
The following steps will ensure your project is cloned properly.

1. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeVanilla.git`
2. `cd SpongeVanilla`
3. `cp scripts/pre-commit .git/hooks`

**Note**: If you accidentally omit `--recursive` option when cloning, you may
delete the repository and try again, or you may execute the following to fix the
situation:

	git submodule update --init --recursive

## Setup
**Note**: SpongeVanilla uses [Gradle] as its build system. The repo includes the Gradle wrapper that will automatically download the correct Gradle 
version. Local installations of Gradle may work but are untested. To execute the Gradle wrapper, run the `./gradlew` script on Unix systems or only
`gradlew` on Windows systems.

Before you are able to build SpongeVanilla, you must first prepare the environment:

  - Run `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace --refresh-dependencies`

### IDE Setup
__For [Eclipse]__
  1. Run `./gradlew eclipse`
  2. Import SpongeVanilla as an existing project (File > Import > General)
  3. Select the root folder for SpongeVanilla and make sure `Search for nested projects` is enabled
  4. Check SpongeVanilla when it finishes building and click **Finish**

__For [IntelliJ]__
  1. Make sure you have the Gradle plugin enabled (File > Settings > Plugins. For **macOS** users: IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences > Plugins).  
  2. Click File > New > Project from Existing Sources > Gradle and select the root folder for SpongeVanilla.
  3. Make sure _Use default gradle wrapper_ is selected. Older/newer Gradle versions may work but we only test using the wrapper.

## Running
__Note:__ The following is aimed to help you setup run configurations for Eclipse and IntelliJ, if you do not want to be able to run SpongeVanilla directly from your IDE then you can skip this.

__For [Eclipse]__ 
  1. Running `./gradlew eclipse` should have generated the run configurations automatically.
  2. When launching the server for the first time, it will shutdown by itself. You will need to modify eula.txt to set eula=true (this means you agree to the Mojang EULA, if you do not wish to do this then you cannot run the server).

__For [IntelliJ]__
  1. Run `./gradlew genIntelliJRuns`
  2. Restart IntelliJ IDEA or reload the project, the run configuration should now be generated.
  3. When launching the server for the first time, it will shutdown by itself. You will need to modify eula.txt to set eula=true (this means you agree to the Mojang EULA, if you do not wish to do this then you cannot run the server).

## Building
__Note:__ You must [setup the environment](#setup) before you can build SpongeVanilla.

In order to build SpongeVanilla you simply need to run the `gradlew` command. On Windows systems you should run `gradlew` instead of `./gradlew` to
invoke the Gradle wrapper. You can find the compiled JAR files in `./build/libs`. You can find the compiled JAR files in `./build/libs` but in most cases
you'll only need 'spongevanilla-x.x.x-x.x-x.jar'.

## Updating your Clone
The following steps will update your clone with the official repo.

1. `git pull`
2. `git submodule update --recursive`
3. `./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace --refresh-dependencies`

## FAQ
__A dependency was added, but my IDE is missing it! How do I add it?__
>If a new dependency was added, you can just restart your IDE and the Gradle plugin for that IDE should pull in the new dependencies.

## Contributing
Are you a talented programmer looking to contribute some code? We'd love the help!
* Open a pull request with your changes, following our [guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Please follow the above guidelines for your pull request(s) to be accepted.

__Help! Things are not working!__
>Some issues can be resolved by deleting the '.gradle' folder in your user directory and running through the setup steps again, or even running `gradle cleanCache` and running through the setup again. Otherwise if you are having trouble with something that the README does not cover, feel free to join our IRC channel and ask for assistance.
